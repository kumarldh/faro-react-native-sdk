## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- `instrumentationOptions.enableFetchInstrumentation` and
  `instrumentationOptions.enableXhrInstrumentation` options on
  `TracingInstrumentation` to control which OpenTelemetry HTTP
  instrumentation is registered.

### Changed

- XHR tracing is now opt-in (`enableXhrInstrumentation` defaults to `false`).
  React Native implements `fetch` on top of XHR, so registering both
  instrumentations produced duplicate spans for the same request. Apps that
  instrument XHR directly (for example some axios setups) should set
  `enableXhrInstrumentation: true`.

### Fixed

- Outbound `fetch`/XHR requests now carry W3C `traceparent` (and
  `tracestate`/`baggage`) headers so client and backend spans join in the
  same trace. `TracingInstrumentation` now registers a global
  `ContextManager` and `TextMapPropagator` instead of relying on the OTel
  noop defaults, which previously prevented header injection.
- Metro dev-server `/symbolicate` requests are no longer traced. Real
  backend `/symbolicate` endpoints are unaffected.
- Suppressed `Deprecated API for given entry type.` warnings by polyfilling
  `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')` to return `[]`. React Native
  does not implement Resource Timing.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-15

- Wait until session device attributes are initialized before initializing Faro
  to avoid lost data during initialization

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2026-03-27

may still change before `1.0.0` stable.
